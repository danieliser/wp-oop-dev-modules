# wp-oop-dev-modules
A collection of reusable code modules you can use when building plugins &amp; themes.

All code is PHP 5.3+ and uses namespaces.

We use an autoloader, check out the autoloader example for more info.

Can easily be adapted to use class prefixes for PHP 5.2 compatibility in older plugins.

Each module is documented inline.
